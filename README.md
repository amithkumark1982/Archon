## What Archon does:
- Turns a regular single-chain miner into a multi-chain miner via intelligent and customizable queue management
- Is compatible with Scavenger and Blago proof-of-capacity (PoC) mining software
- Like Scavenger, Archon is written using the Rust systems language; memory-safe, cross-platform, low-footprint and stable
- Features:
  - Collision free
  - Can run in *priority* __or__ *first in, first out* queuing modes
  - Can interrupt lower priority blocks (toggleable)
  - Compatible with HDPool mining (directly, without the use of HDProxy or another program)
  - [Customizable per-chain settings](https://github.com/Bloodreaver/Archon#all-configuration-options-for-poc-chains):
    - Dynamic Deadlines (auto adjust for network difficulty based on total plot capacity)
    - Target deadline (for the entire chain)
    - Target deadline overrides (per ID)
    - Define passphrases for solo burst mining (per ID)
    - Requeue interrupted blocks (toggleable)
    - Adjustable *getMiningInfo* interval

## What Archon does not do:
- Mine
- Provide lambos

## How it works
Archon acts as an intermediary between your mining software and your upstream pool/wallet(s).
Trying to be brief, for each chain you instruct Archon to manage, it will:
```
- Create a thread and poll for *new* mining info
  - Determines if the new mining info should be mined immediately, or queued, using a logical flow system
- Wait for connections from your miners, just like a normal pool/wallet would do
  - Upon receiving a `getMiningInfo` request, asynchronously sends the *current mining info* to the miner
  - Upon receiving a `submitNonce` request (deadline submission) from a miner, uses logic to determine which chain the submission is for and whether to forward the deadline to the upstream pool/wallet
    - Do not send Upstream: Asynchronously sends a fake confirmation back to the miner
      - This will be the case if either of the following is true:
        - The submitted deadline is greater than the target deadline for this chain
        - The submitted deadline is greater than previously submitted deadlines by the account ID for this block height
    - Send Upstream: Asynchronously sends the deadline submission upstream, and awaits the result, forwarding the result back to the miner
- Once a second, in a separate thread, processes any blocks waiting to be mined, using logic to determine when to start mining them.
```

## Defining your mining chains
Archon supports mining multiple chains in either a `priority mode (default)` or a `first in, first out mode`, you would only use the latter if you didn't value mining any one chain over another.

Your PoC chains are defined in the `archon.yaml` configuration file, [see below](https://github.com/Bloodreaver/Archon#sample-configuration-file).

Note: You must have at least one PoC Chain defined, or Archon will have nothing to do!

Example chain layouts for different purposes, using the bare minimum information required by Archon:
```yaml
pocChains:
# BHD via HDProxy
#  (You must have HDProxy running on the same machine as Archon with these settings!)
  - name: First Chain
    priority: 0
    url: "http://localhost:60100"
    isHdpool: true
    color: cyan

# BHD via HDPool (Direct - no other applications needed)
  - name: Second Chain
    priority: 1
  # Your HDPool account key goes here:
    accountKey: abcdefg-abcdefg-abcdefg-abcdefg
    isHdpool: true
#    minerName: My Miner
    color: blue

# BHD via HPool
  - name: Third Chain
    priority: 2
  # Your HPool API Key / Account key goes here:
    accountKey: abcdefg-abcdefg-abcdefg-abcdefg
    isHpool: true
    url: "http://btchd.hpool.com"
#    minerName: My Miner
    color: yellow

# BHD Solo
#  (You must have a BHD wallet running in mining mode / with RPC server on,
#   on the same machine as Archon is running on with these settings!)
  - name: Fourth Chain
    priority: 3
    isBhd: true
    url: "http://localhost:8732"
    color: green

# Burst Pool mining via voiplanparty.com
  - name: Fifth Chain
    priority: 4
    url: "http://voiplanparty.com:8124"
    isPool: true
    color: magenta

# Burst Solo mining
#  (You must have a Burst wallet running on the same machine as Archon with these settings!)
  - name: Sixth Chain
    priority: 5
    url: "http://localhost:8125"
    numericIdToPassphrase:
      12345678901234567890: passphrase for this numeric id goes here

```

## All Configuration Options for PoC Chains
If you need more control over your chains, you can add any of these parameters to each chain. There is no set order to these.
- `name`
  - Required (But can be blank)
  - Used for displaying a friendly chain name in the Archon console.
- `enabled`
  - Optional. Default = true
  - If this is set to false, Archon will ignore this chain completely.
- `priority`
  - Required (But only used if `priorityMode` = `true`)
  - A 0-based priority index. 0 = highest priority. MUST BE UNIQUE PER CHAIN.
- `isHpool`
  - Optional. Default = false. **REQUIRED FOR MINING BHD VIA `HPOOL`**
  - Set to true if this chain is for mining BHD via HPool. This will instruct Archon to send the supplied `accountKey` value to HPool on deadline submissions. *Note: If this is true, you do not need to set `isBhd` or `isPool`.*
  - **NOTE:** You may only specify `isHpool` **OR** `isHdpool` on each chain - specifying both as true will result in a fatal error.
- `isHdpool`
  - Optional. Default = false. **REQUIRED FOR MINING BHD VIA `HDPOOL`**
  - Set to true if this chain is for mining via HDPool. **To instruct Archon to talk directly to HDPool via websockets instead of via HDProxy, set this to `true` and specify your `accountKey` (See below).** *Note: If this is true, you do not need to set `isBhd` or `isPool`.*
  - **NOTE:** You may only specify `isHpool` **OR** `isHdpool` on each chain - specifying both as true will result in a fatal error.
- `accountKey`
  - Optional. **REQUIRED FOR MINING BHD THROUGH `HPOOL` or `HDPOOL` _(Direct only, not required if you are using HDProxy for HDPool)_**
  - If this chain is for mining BHD via HPool or HDPool (directly), set this to your Account Key so that Archon can supply it when communicating with the pool. *Not used if `isHpool` and `isHdpool` are both false.*
- `minerName`
  - Optional.
  - Set this to use a custom name for reporting your miner name to your upstream pool, it will be reported as `<MINER_NAME> via Archon v<VERSION>`
  - If not specified, the following will apply:
    - If the chain is for HPool or HDPool, Archon will attempt to retrieve your device's hostname, and report your miner as `<HOSTNAME> via Archon v<VERSION>` if successful - where `<HOSTNAME>` is the name of your computer or device. If Archon cannot retrieve the hostname, your miner will be reported simply as `Archon v<VERSION>`. 
    - For other chains, Archon will automatically set the miner name as `<MINING SOFTWARE USER AGENT> via Archon v<VERSION>` to avoid potentially expose your identity to the public.
  - *Note: The User-Agent header that Archon sends with submissions will **always** be `<MINING SOFTWARE USER AGENT> via Archon v<VERSION>`, you cannot customise that. This is only intended to give you a way to control the name that appears in the HDPool / HPool web interface, for monitoring purposes.*
- `isBhd`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - Set to true if the chain is mining BHD/BTCHD/BitcoinHD. Not required if `isHpool` or `isHdpool` is set to `true`.
- `isPool`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - Set to true if the chain is mining via a pool. Not required if `isHpool` or `isHdpool` is set to `true`.
- `url`
  - Required; **but may be left out if the chain is for `HDPool`.**
  - Must be a fully qualified URI including protocol, domain/IP and port, eg: `"http://voiplanparty.com:8124"`
  - If you wish to mine via HDPool **and use HDProxy**, do not specify `accountKey`, set `isHdpool` to `true`, and set `url` to your HDProxy URL, (eg `url: "http://localhost:60100"` if HDProxy is running on the same machine as Archon)
- `historicalRounds`
  - Optional. Default = 360
  - Not used at the moment, but will be used later for statistics displayed in the Web UI (which is not implemented currently).
- `targetDeadline`
  - Optional. Default = 18446744073709551615 (u64::max) or the pool/wallet's maximum deadline, if given.
  - Set this to the desired maximum deadline. Any deadlines submitted to Archon for this chain which are higher than this value will not be sent upstream.
- `numericIdToPassphrase`
  - Optional.
  - Use this if this chain is for solo mining BURST.
  - Example format:
```yaml
numericIdToPassphrase:
  12345678901234567890: passphrase for this numeric id goes here
```
- `numericIdToTargetDeadline`
  - Optional.
  - Use this section to specify OVERRIDES for target deadlines. 
  - *Note: If a deadline is submitted from an ID specified here, for this chain, this target deadline WILL be used, provided it is under the maximum deadline reported by the upstream pool/wallet, if given.*
  - Example format:
```yaml
numericIdToTargetDeadline:
  12345678901234567890: 86400          # 1 day target deadline for ID 12345678901234567890
```
- `color`
  - Required.
  - Specify a color for Archon to display info for this chain in.
  - Valid colors:
    - green
    - yellow
    - blue
    - magenta
    - cyan
    - white
- `getMiningInfoInterval`
  - Optional. Default = 3 seconds
  - Specify the interval, in seconds, that Archon will request mining info for this chain. Minimum is 1 second.
- `useDynamicDeadlines`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - If set to true, Archon will calculate your target deadline dynamically for each block, for this chain only.
- `allowLowerBlockHeights`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - If set to true, Archon will change its new-block-detection method from "block height greater than previous" to "block height not equal to previous" for this chain only, which will consequently allow a lower block height to be mined in the same chain.
    - Use case: Only really useful if this chain is pointing at a multi-chain proxy, or a pool that mines multiple chains. *cough PoCC cough*
- `requeueInterruptedBlocks`
  - Optional. Default = true
  - If you disable this feature, this chain's blocks which get interrupted by a higher priority chain **WILL NOT** be requeued and mined after the higher priority chain finishes.
  - Only used if Archon is running in priority mode with block interrupting enabled (which is the default).
    - Use case: If this chain is a testnet chain or something you don't really care about mining every block for.
- `maximumRequeueTimes`
  - Optional.
  - Specify a maximum number of times that a block for this chain will be requeued.
  - Only used if Archon is running in priority mode with block interrupting enabled (which is the default), and `requeueInterruptedBlocks` has not been disabled for this chain.
    - Use case: For something like mining a testnet where you don't want to continually mine the same block if it keeps getting interrupted by a higher priority chain.

## Global Configuration Options
Use these configuration options to control Archon's behavior.
- `gracePeriod`
  - Required.
  - __The amount of time that must elapse after a block starts, before Archon considers the block to be "complete".__
  - **This value is extremely important**, it is used as a timer by Archon to determine how much time must elapse after a block starts before Archon can send the next queued block to be mined, and also whether or not a new block should cause an old block to be interrupted (and perhaps requeued). Set it too small, and Archon will instruct your miners to start mining a new block before they've finished scanning the previous one. Conversely, set it too long, and you risk missing blocks entirely. Ideally it should be set around 5 seconds longer than your regular scan times. *(5 seconds just to give it a safety net to compensate for fluctuations)*
- `priorityMode`
  - Optional. Default = true
  - This controls how Archon determines the order in which to send blocks to be mined.
    - `true` - Running in priority mode means that Archon will send new blocks immediately from higher priority chains that are currently being mined, ensuring that your higher priority blocks get mined ASAP. It also means that if multiple blocks are queued, Archon will always start the one from the highest priority chain first.
    - `false` - Running in [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) mode means that Archon will not interrupt blocks, since all chains are the same priority, and Archon will always start the oldest block from the queue first.
- `interruptLowerPriorityBlocks`
  - Optional. Default = true
  - This option is only used in priority mode. If enabled, it will interrupt a currently mining block from a lower-priority chain, in order to mine a new block from a higher priority chain ASAP. The default behavior then is to requeue the lower priority block, but this can be overridden with a per-chain setting.
- `webServerBindAddress`
  - Required.
  - Specify the IP binding you wish Archon to listen for connections on. `0.0.0.0` is universal. `127.0.0.1` is local machine only. You can also use the LAN IP of the host machine if you wish.
- `webServerPort`
  - Required.
  - Specify the Port that Archon will listen for incoming connections from your miners and for serving the Web UI on.
- `usePocChainColors`
  - Optional. Default = true.
  - If enabled, events (new block, deadline submitted etc) pertaining to a defined PoC Chain will be printed in the color specified in that chain's configuration.
  - If disabled, most of the printing will be in white.
- `outageStatusUpdateInterval`
  - Optional. Default = 300 seconds / 5 minutes
  - This just avoids spamming the console with errors in the event of an outage.
- `showHumanReadableDeadlines`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - Appends a human readable time to deadlines and other durations. Eg: 3345951 **(1m 8d 17:25:51)**
- `maskAccountIdsInConsole`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - Hides all but the first and last three digits in the console of numeric IDs which submit deadlines to Archon. Eg: ID 12345678901234567890 => **1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX890**
    - Use case: None. I'm just paranoid. Use it if you wish :)
- `use24HourTime`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - If enabled, times printed to console will be in 24 hour format.
- `numOldLogFilesToKeep`
  - Optional. Default = 5
  - Keeps this many *old* files in the `logs/` folder. A new `archon.log` file will be created and old files rotated every time Archon is launched. If `loggingLevel` = `Off`, this setting is not used. *Note: Archon will __never__ delete files, it will only overwrite log files as per normal, up to the limit specified here.*
- `loggingLevel`
  - Optional. Default = `info` *(this is case insensitive)*
  - Sets how verbose Archon's file logging is.
    - I recommend leaving this on **info**, as debug and trace levels are *very* verbose and file sizes can get large, quickly..
  - Valid options:
    - `Off` - Disable file logging entirely. *Note: Archon will not create a logs directory with this set.*
    - `Trace` - Show **ALL** logs __(not recommended unless you're troubleshooting)__
    - `Debug` - Show all logs except Trace logs __(not recommended unless you're troubleshooting)__
    - `Info` - Recommended. Shows logs with **INFO|WARN|ERROR** levels.
    - `Warn` - Only show **WARN|ERROR** level logs.
    - `Error` - Only show **ERROR** level logs.
- `dependencyLoggingLevel`
  - Optional. Default = `info` *(this is case insensitive)*
  - Sets how verbose Archon's *dependencies* file logging is.
    - I recommend leaving this on **info**, as debug and trace levels are *very* verbose and file sizes can get large, quickly.
  - Valid options:
    - `Off` - Disable dependency logging entirely.
    - `Trace` - Show **ALL** logs __(not recommended unless you're troubleshooting)__
    - `Debug` - Show all logs except Trace logs __(not recommended unless you're troubleshooting)__
    - `Info` - Recommended. Shows logs with **INFO|WARN|ERROR** levels.
    - `Warn` - Only show **WARN|ERROR** level logs.
    - `Error` - Only show **ERROR** level logs.
- `showMinerAddresses`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - Shows the address that deadline submissions are received from.
- `initialPlotCapacity`
  - Optional.
  - You may specify this as a value to use for initial plot capacity just after Archon starts up. *It will only be used until Archon receives info from your miners about your plot capacity, use it if you wish to use dynamic deadlines and your miner doesn't submit capacity headers until it submits a nonce. Or, update to a miner that does! (Scavenger 1.7.6 submits headers on getMiningInfo requests, which is much better)*
- `minerUpdateTimeout`
  - Optional. Default = 1800 (30 minutes)
  - The amount of time that a miner must stop communicating with Archon for, for Archon to ignore that miner's capacity in Plot Capacity calculations.
  - If a miner doesn't communicate with Archon for longer than this period, Archon will no longer consider that miner's reported capacity as part of your total plot size. *For example, with the default setting of 30 minutes: If Miner System A has 50 TiB and Miner System B has 30 TiB, but Miner System B stops communication with Archon for 30 minutes or more, Archon will report your total plot capacity as 50 TiB rather than 80 TiB.*

## Sample configuration file
Archon will look in the working directory (usually the same location as the executable) for `archon.yaml`.

If the file cannot be loaded or is non-existent, Archon will ask you if you would like to generate one. Be warned: If you agree, Archon will overwrite any existing `archon.yaml` file in the working directory, this is not reversible!

# What follows is a default chain configuration, set up to mine BHD via HDProxy running on the same machine as Archon, and
# Burst via the VoipLanParty.com pool.
# A Testnet pool chain is also there, but disabled by default as most people won't wish to mine it.

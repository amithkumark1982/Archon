# Archon
A collision free, multi-chain proof of capacity mining proxy.

## What Archon does:
- Turns a regular single-chain miner into a multi-chain miner via intelligent and customizable queue management
- Is compatible with Scavenger and Blago proof-of-capacity (PoC) mining software
- Like Scavenger, Archon is written using the Rust systems language; memory-safe, cross-platform, low-footprint and stable
- Features:
  - Collision free
  - Can run in *priority* __or__ *first in, first out* queuing modes
  - Can interrupt lower priority blocks (toggleable)
  - [Customizable per-chain settings](https://github.com/Bloodreaver/Archon#all-configuration-options-for-poc-chains):
    - Dynamic Deadlines (auto adjust for network difficulty based on total plot capacity)
    - Target deadline (for the entire chain)
    - Target deadline overrides (per ID)
    - Define passphrases for solo burst mining (per ID)
    - Requeue interrupted blocks (toggleable)
    - Adjustable *getMiningInfo* interval

## What Archon (currently) does not do:
- Mine
- Replace HDProxy
- Provide lambos

## How it works
Archon acts as an intermediary between your mining software and your upstream pool/wallet(s).
Trying to be brief, for each chain you instruct Archon to manage, it will:
```
- Create a thread and poll for *new* mining info
  - Determines if the new mining info should be mined immediately, or queued, using a logical flow system
- Wait for connections from your miners, just like a normal pool/wallet would do
  - Upon receiving a `getMiningInfo` request, asynchronously sends the *current mining info* to the miner
  - Upon receiving a `submitNonce` request (deadline submission) from a miner, uses logic to determine which chain the submission is for and whether to forward the deadline to the upstream pool/wallet
    - Do not send Upstream: Asynchronously sends a fake confirmation back to the miner
      - This will be the case if either of the following is true:
        - The submitted deadline is greater than the target deadline for this chain
        - The submitted deadline is greater than previously submitted deadlines by the account ID for this block height
    - Send Upstream: Asynchronously sends the deadline submission upstream, and awaits the result, forwarding the result back to the miner
- Once a second, in a separate thread, processes any blocks waiting to be mined, using logic to determine when to start mining them.
```

## Defining your mining chains
Archon supports mining multiple chains in either a `priority mode (default)` or a `first in, first out mode`, you would only use the latter if you didn't value mining any one chain over another.

Your PoC chains are defined in the `archon.yaml` configuration file, [see below](https://github.com/Bloodreaver/Archon#sample-configuration-file).

Note: You must have at least one PoC Chain defined, or Archon will have nothing to do!

Example layout, using the bare minimum information required by Archon:
```yaml
pocChains:
  - name: First Chain
    priority: 0
    url: "http://localhost:60100"
    isBhd: true
    isPool: true
    color: cyan
  - name: Second Chain
    priority: 1
    url: "http://voiplanparty.com:8124"
    isPool: true
    color: magenta
```

## All Configuration Options for PoC Chains
If you need more control over your chains, you can add any of these parameters to each chain. There is no set order to these.
- `name`
  - Required (But can be blank)
  - Used for displaying a friendly chain name in the Archon console.
- `enabled`
  - Optional. Default = true
  - If this is set to false, Archon will ignore this chain completely.
- `priority`
  - Required (But only used if `priorityMode` = `true`)
  - A 0-based priority index. 0 = highest priority. MUST BE UNIQUE PER CHAIN.
- `isBhd`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - Set to true if the chain is mining BHD/BTCHD/BitcoinHD.
- `isPool`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - Set to true if the chain is mining via a pool.
- `url`
  - Required.
  - Must be a fully qualified URI including protocol, domain/IP and port, eg: "http://voiplanparty.com:8124"
- `historicalRounds`
  - Optional. Default = 360
  - Not used at the moment, but will be used later for statistics displayed in the Web UI (which is not implemented currently).
- `targetDeadline`
  - Optional. Default = 18446744073709551615 (u64::max) or the pool/wallet's maximum deadline, if given.
  - Set this to the desired maximum deadline. Any deadlines submitted to Archon for this chain which are higher than this value will not be sent upstream.
- `numericIdToPassphrase`
  - Optional.
  - Use this section if this chain is for solo mining BURST.
  - Example format:
```yaml
numericIdToPassphrase:
  12345678901234567890: passphrase for this numeric id goes here
```
- `numericIdToTargetDeadline`
  - Optional.
  - Use this section to specify OVERRIDES for target deadlines. 
  - *Note: If a deadline is submitted from an ID specified here, for this chain, this target deadline WILL be used, provided it is under the maximum deadline reported by the upstream pool/wallet, if given.*
  - Example format:
```yaml
numericIdToTargetDeadline:
  12345678901234567890: 86400          # 1 day target deadline for ID 12345678901234567890
```
- `color`
  - Required.
  - Specify a color for Archon to display info for this chain in.
  - Valid colors:
    - green
    - yellow
    - blue
    - magenta
    - cyan
    - white
- `getMiningInfoInterval`
  - Optional. Default = 3 seconds
  - Specify the interval, in seconds, that Archon will request mining info for this chain. Minimum is 1 second.
- `useDynamicDeadlines`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - If set to true, and you have specified a total plot size in your Archon configuration, Archon will calculate your target deadline dynamically for each block, for this chain only.
- `allowLowerBlockHeights`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - If set to true, Archon will change its new-block-detection method from "block height greater than previous" to "block height not equal to previous" for this chain only, which will consequently allow a lower block height to be mined in the same chain.
    - Use case: Only really useful if this chain is pointing at a multi-chain proxy, or a pool that mines multiple chains. *cough PoCC cough*
- `requeueInterruptedBlocks`
  - Optional. Default = true
  - If you disable this feature, this chain's blocks which get interrupted by a higher priority chain **WILL NOT** be requeued and mined after the higher priority chain finishes.
    - Use case: If this chain is a testnet chain or something you don't really care about mining every block for.

## Global Configuration Options
Use these configuration options to control Archon's behavior.
- `gracePeriod`
  - Required.
  - **This value is extremely important**, it is used as a timer by Archon to determine how much time must elapse after a block starts before Archon can send the next queued block to be mined. Set it too small, and Archon will instruct your miners to start mining a new block before they've finished scanning the previous one. Conversely, set it too long, and you risk missing blocks entirely. Ideally it should be set around 5 seconds longer than your regular scan times, 5 seconds just to give it a safety net.
- `priorityMode`
  - Optional. Default = true
  - This controls how Archon determines the order in which to send blocks to be mined.
    - `true` - Running in priority mode means that Archon will send new blocks immediately from higher priority chains that are currently being mined, ensuring that your higher priority blocks get mined ASAP. It also means that if multiple blocks are queued, Archon will always start the one from the highest priority chain first.
    - `false` - Running in [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) mode means that Archon will not interrupt blocks, since all chains are the same priority, and Archon will always start the oldest block from the queue first.
- `interruptLowerPriorityBlocks`
  - Optional. Default = true
  - This option is only used in priority mode. If enabled, it will interrupt a currently mining block from a lower-priority chain, in order to mine a new block from a higher priority chain ASAP. The default behavior then is to requeue the lower priority block, but this can be overridden with a per-chain setting.
- `webServerBindAddress`
  - Required.
  - Specify the IP binding you wish Archon to listen for connections on. `0.0.0.0` is universal. `127.0.0.1` is local machine only. You can also use the LAN IP of the host machine if you wish.
- `webServerPort`
  - Required.
  - Specify the Port that Archon will listen for incoming connections from your miners and for serving the Web UI on.
- `usePocChainColors`
  - Optional. Default = true.
  - If enabled, events (new block, deadline submitted etc) pertaining to a defined PoC Chain will be printed in the color specified in that chain's configuration.
  - If disabled, most of the printing will be in white.
- `outageStatusUpdateInterval`
  - Optional. Default = 300 seconds / 5 minutes
  - This just avoids spamming the console with errors in the event of an outage. It's effectively a cooldown; Archon will only print an error message / status update about the outage when this period of time has elapsed since it printed the last error message / status update.
- `totalPlotsSizeInTebibytes` *(1 TiB = 2^40 bytes)*
- `totalPlotsSizeInTerabytes` *(1 TB = 10^12 bytes)*
- `totalPlotsSizeInGibibytes` *(1 GiB = 2^30 bytes)*
- `totalPlotsSizeInGigabytes` *(1 GB = 10^9 bytes)*
  - These are all optional, the only reason there are 4 of them is for convenience, so you don't have to convert units. Just fill in whichever one you know. **NOTE:** *If you decide to fill in more than one of these, Archon will __add them together__ to calculate a total.*
  - These values are used for calculating dynamic deadlines. If you don't have any specified, dynamic deadlines will be disabled automatically.
  - When HDProxy functionality is implemented, Archon will also use these values for reporting your capacity to HDPool. **WARNING:** *Overstating your capacity to HDPool (aka cheating) is likely to get your account banned and your funds forfeited. Be fair to other miners and be honest, it's in everyone's best interests!*
- `showHumanReadableDeadlines`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - Appends a human readable time to deadlines and other durations. Eg: 3345951 **(1m 8d 17:25:51)**
- `maskAccountIdsInConsole`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - Hides all but the first and last three digits in the console of numeric IDs which submit deadlines to Archon. Eg: ID 12345678901234567890 => **1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX890**
    - Use case: None. I'm just paranoid. Use it if you wish :)
- `use24HourTime`
  - Optional. Default = false
  - If enabled, times printed to console will be in 24 hour format.

## Sample configuration file
Archon will look in the working directory (usually the same location as the executable) for `archon.yaml`.

If the file cannot be loaded or is non-existent, Archon will ask you if you would like to generate one. Be warned: If you agree, Archon will overwrite any existing `archon.yaml` file in the working directory, this is not reversible!
